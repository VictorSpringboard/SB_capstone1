Capstone Idea # 1: Movie DB
	Users can search for films/TV programs by filtering for actors, genres, time periods and so on. 
    They can add films to lists (multiple, if desired) and add their comments/star ratings to each film. 
    The app will give the user information on which streaming service is offered for each film, as well as the costs involved
     to subscribe to a streaming service, purchase the film, or rent the film. 

Capstone Idea #2: Recipe DB	
	Users can search for recipes based on available ingredients in their refrigerator, various cuisines (french, italian, chinese, etc),
    trending recipes, etc. They can save recipes to lists and comment/rate their own and other users’ recipes.
    Users can also make and save their own recipes, then share those recipes with other users (by tagging). 

Capstone Idea #3: Fantasy Baseball
	Users can search for players and fill out their teams for any fantasy leagues they are in. 
    They can track their teams’ progress and explore possible free agents. 
    Users can access player ratings and forecasts and use that to help plan their teams. 
    The main reason I chose this project idea is because I play in a fantasy baseball league with several friends who would be willing to
    engage in testing or to try out the app.
