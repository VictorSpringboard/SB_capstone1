# 1. What goal will your website be designed to achieve?
    The goal of my website is to provide a space where users can keep track of films/tv shows they've seen. Users will be given a list of streaming services that offer the material they are interested in. They can find new material to watch by searching for genres, actors, directors, etc. Users can maintain multiple lists of 
    things they've seen or plan on seeing. They can also share lists with other users or collaborate on a list with other users. If the user wishes, they can make lists public to be seen by other users, or private to be visible only to them.
    
# 2. What kind of users will visit your site? In other words, what is the demographic of your users?
    -The demographic of my website is anyone with a subscription to a streaming service. People who watch a lot of movies and TV (like myself) will benefit from my website by keeping their watching habits organized.

# 3. What data do you plan on using? You may have not picked your actual API yet, which is fine, just outline what kind of data you would like it to contain.
    -I plan to use "searchable" data about movies and tv. I want my users to search for things they've seen already, as well as tv which may be of interest. Data about actors, directors, genres, and streaming services. 

# 4. In brief, outline your approach to creating your project (knowing that you may not know everything in advance and that these details might change later). Answer questions like the ones below, but feel free to add more information:

## a. What does your database schema look like?
    Tables for users and their film lists. Lists will have tags for genres and actors, as well as tags of other users. 
## b. What kinds of issues might you run into with your API?
    I have an API in mind, it is a TV and movie Database API. I've already registered for a free API key but I'm not sure what the limitations are. I'll look into it.
## c. Is there any sensitive information you need to secure?
    Usernames and passwords will be stored in encrypted form. 
## d. What functionality will your app include?
    I plan to implement sharing lists and posts from my website onto users' other social media profiles. 
## e. What will the user flow look like?
    Once the user logs in, they can search for new material to watch, or they can start making lists of what they've already seen. They'll be able to search for other users and see what their lists look like. 
## f. What features make your site more than CRUD? Do you have any stretch goals?
    It would be interesting to implement some sort of basic user discussion forum. Also, some functionality where users can upvote or downvote other user lists.
